        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, 
            one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence 
            on the philosophy of science. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for 
            his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing 
            quantum theory.
